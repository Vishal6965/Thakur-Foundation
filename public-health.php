      <p>The objective behind our grant is to spread awareness about India’s public health issues, build capacity, and influence policy by bringing these issues into the mainstream narrative.</p>
      <p>India’s public healthcare system constantly fails the medical needs of its poor and marginalized communities. It is marked by wide disparities in management, accountability, ethics, budgetary allocations, and resources. These obstacles can be attributed to fundamental constraints, such as a shortfall in infrastructure, medical facilities, trained professionals, and allied health services.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="para-txt pb0">
      <p>Due to a lack of awareness, there exists an immense reliance on alternative, traditional forms of medicine, often propagated by practitioners or individuals without professional qualifications.</p>
      <p>We believe that there is a deep-rooted need for awareness, information, accessibility, and capacity building to address these gaps. </p>

                          <p>One of our current areas of interest is to build capacity for journalism in healthcare. Toward that end, we solicit grants annually for investigative reporting in Public Health. We exercise no editorial control over the content of the deliverables. Grantees can report in regional languages or English, and are expected to publish their work at a reputable media organization. For more information, please read about the 2019 Investigative Reporting in Public Health Grants.</p>
