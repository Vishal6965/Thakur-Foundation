      <p>Civil liberties form the foundation of any democracy. By supporting individuals and organizations and aiding causes that advance protection of civil liberties, we aim to promote accountability of the state toward its citizens and foster the creation of an inclusive, non-discriminatory society.</p>
      <p>We support projects that enable investigative reporting into the violation of civil liberties, public interest litigations, research, and scholarship on a variety of topics that fall within this broad area.</p>

      <p>We encourage projects that use the Right to Information (RTI) Act as a tool for increasing transparency and accountability in governance. By bridging gaps around the implementation of the RTI Act, our grants aim to facilitate a review of the operation of the Act, the functioning of Public Information Officers, the State Information Commissions, and the Central Information Commission.</p>
      <p>Apart from projects that focus on the implementation of the RTI Act, we also fund research in the area of prevention detention, and offer fellowships to young lawyers or activists working in the field of civil liberties.</p>
