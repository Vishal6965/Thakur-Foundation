      <p>Since April 2019, the Thakur Foundation has promoted access to information through investigative grants with a focus to develop an inclusive, accepting society in India.</p>
      <p>The vision for a participative, aware, and just society, led to the genesis of the Thakur Foundation. The primary goal was to go upstream with a systems-change approach that addressed the root causes of a problem, and develop an ingrained culture of accountability through strategic, impact-focused philanthropy.</p>
